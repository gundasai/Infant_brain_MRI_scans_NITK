Infant brain mri segmentation 

Abstract—The growth of the brain from infantile to adoles-
cence is very complex. It spans for a very long time, so there are

many processes such as myelination, migration, neural induction,
and many other time taking processes to study the development
of the brain, so there is a need for some automatic tools so
that it becomes easy in studying the development of Brain.
Developing tools for grownup humans is not so tricky as the
brain is already grown, but for six month’s child still is in the
growing stage, there is the difficulty; nevertheless, developing
tools for all ages is required. Segmentation of MRI images of
the brain is crucial to understand the growth patterns of the
brain. The brain consists of mainly three parts white matter,
gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. So, by quantitative tools, if
the brain MRI images segmented into these three different parts,
it will be a great boon for the medical community to deal with
the brain. Although there are some tools for segmenting adult
MRI images but for 6-month child segmentation of the brain
becomes challenging as the white matter, and gray matter is
almost undistinguishable due to the brain development process.

Segmentation of brain MRI images can identify specific pat-
terns that contribute to healthy brain development. The data set

of this problem statement had taken from the iseg-2019 challenge
conducted by MICCAI.
Segmentation of MRI into white matter, gray matter, and
cerebrospinal fluid need expert doctors. Advancement in
computer vision techniques can be used to replace present
time-consuming work.This paper proposes a deep learning
model for image segmentation using U-net. Various experiments
had done with popular deep learning models like U-net, dense
net, and attention net.U-net performed better than all other
models and resulted in an accuracy of 85.64.
